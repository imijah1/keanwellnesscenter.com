            <p><b>According to college student mental health statistics, around 1,100 US college students commit suicide every year and 24,000 attempt to take their lives.

                College students are exposed to a lot of pressure and stress, which negatively impacts their mental health. 
                In the past decade, the number of students treated for mental disorders has been on the rise. 
                Experts confirm that things have worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic started.</b></p> <!-- Course section -->
